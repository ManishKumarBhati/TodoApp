- [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/)
- [Coroutines Flow API](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines/flow.html)
- [Android Architecture Components](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture)
- [Android desugaring for Java 8+ APIs](https://developer.android.com/studio/write/java8-support#library-desugaring)
- [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/)
- [Moshi](https://github.com/square/moshi)
- [Glide]( https://github.com/bumptech/glide)
- [Hilt](https://dagger.dev/hilt/) for dependency injection
- [Android KTX](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/ktx) features
- [Robolectric]( http://robolectric.org/androidx_test/) for unit testing

### Scope for Improvements
 The app can be further improved with the addition of the following features
- jetpack Compose for Ui development.
